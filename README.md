# Blue-Module_1-Project_1
First module 1 project.
For this first project the narrative is inspired on myself, and strong women in my family, especially my mother. Being a teacher in Brazil is a challenge. On top of this fact, add the education required to improve yourself, household chores, and raising children, only having superpowers.
These women are heroines and the questions in this story are in the daily life of every adult. Successfully executing them brings incredible peace and allows us to rest peacefully.
